## Background

A single page react application utilizing esbuild as the build tool and development server.

Configured with Typescript, EsLint, and Prettier.

Currently this application is configured to build a basic React application. More features will be added in the future.


## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/sudo-adduser-jordan/toolchain
```

First, run the development server:

```
cd Toolchain
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `App.tsx`.

This tool does not use HMR and does a full reload on save.
